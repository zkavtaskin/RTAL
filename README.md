# Real-Time Associative Learning

> This repository is under active long term development. Everything in this repository should be considered incomplete.  

### Introduction: 
This moonshot open source project will attempt to implement a real-time general machine learning model based on [real-time associative learning theory](/THEORY.md). 

At this stage [architecture](/IMPLEMENTATION.md) and [implementation](/IMPLEMENTATION.md) is mostly unknown. However, what is known is that learning is associative and is built over time in blocks. Due to this model would need to be trained from the first principles. Overall, implementation is highly likely to include graphs, fractals, heuristics and deep learning. 

### Goals: 
* Establish theory behind using a hypothesis driven approach. 
* Test these hypotheses through deduction and algorithm implementation. 
* Identify theoretical cognitive architectural components.
* Continue this cycle by refining stated hypotheses thus fueling this cycle.
