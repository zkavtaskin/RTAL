# Real-Time Associative Learning

### Introduction: 
This moonshot open source project will attempt to implement a real-time general machine learning model based on [associative theory](/THEORY.md). 

### Implementation: 
At this stage full [implementation](/IMPLEMENTATION.md) is unknown. However, what is known is that learning is associative and is built over time in blocks. Due to this model would need to be trained from the first principles. Overall, implementation is likely to include graphs, fractals, heuristics and deep learning. 

### Goals: 
* Establish theory behind RTAL using a hypothesis driven approach. 
* Test these hypotheses through deduction and RTAL algorithm implementation. 
* Identify theoretical cognitive architectural components needed for RTAL to work. 
* Continue this cycle by refining stated hypotheses thus fueling this cycle.
