# Associative Theory - Work in progress

## Associations

Humans tend to do everything through relationships. These relationships are formed with all objects that humans interact with. These relationships, if they yield some utility, are built over time. Human relationships are complicated as they are formed from various data inputs such as video, audio, texture, smell, taste and internal chemical composition ("feeling"). All of these inputs are meshed together and encoded in a (on average) lossy format. 

For reasons not fully known, encodings are stored for different lengths of time. One of the reasons that certain encodings might be stored for a longer period of time is due to how different the data input is. That is if data input is very different to previous data inputs it is stored for longer. However this is a simplification as there are many factors at play such as relative context of the data input. Human associations are subjective as they are "unique" to the individual and do not necesserly represent the actual "objective" reality. 

## Inference
 
Humans infer through established association boundaries. Inference types fall into the following classes: deduction, induction and abduction. It is believed that humans tend to use abduction and induction by default for inference.
