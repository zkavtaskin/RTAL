# Associative Theory - Work in progress

Humans tend to do everything through relationships. These relationships are formed with all objects that humans interact with. These relationships, if they yield some utility, are built over time. Human relationships are complicated as they are formed from various data inputs such as video, audio, texture, smell, taste and internal chemical composition ("feeling"). All of these inputs are meshed together and encoded in a (on average) lossy format. 

For reasons not fully known, encodings are stored for different lengths of time. One of the reasons that certain encodings might be stored for a longer period of time is due to how different the data input is. That is if data input is very different to previous data inputs it is stored for longer. However this is a simplification as there are many factors at play such as relative context of the data input.
