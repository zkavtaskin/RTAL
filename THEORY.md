# Associative Theory - Work in progress

Humans are intelligent actors with high capacity for associations and inference. For the rest of this write up human like beings (and other mammals with various capacities) will be refered to as intelligent actors.

## Associations

Intelligent actors tend to do everything through relationships. These relationships are formed with all objects that intelligent actors interact with. These relationships, if they yield some utility, are built over time. Intelligent actor's relationships are complicated as they are formed from various data inputs such as video, audio, texture, smell, taste and internal chemical composition ("feeling"). All of these inputs are meshed together and encoded in a (on average) lossy format. 

For reasons not fully known, encodings are stored for different lengths of time. One of the reasons that certain encodings might be stored for a longer period of time is due to how different the data input is. That is if data input is very different to previous data inputs it is stored for longer. However this is a simplification as there are many factors at play such as relative context of the data input. Intelligent actors associations are subjective as they are "unique" to the actor and do not necesserly represent the actual "objective" reality that they operate in. 

## Inference
 
Intelligent actors infer through established association boundaries. Establsuhed inference types fall into the following classes: deduction, induction and abduction. It is believed that intelligent actors tend to use automatic induction (unconscious probabilistic generalization) and abduction (most likely available explanation at hand). These default modes of inference are limited due to intelligent actors' limited association boundaries. However, these quick and dirty techniques have allowed intelligent actors to survive in normally distributed environments for a very long period.
 
Intelligent actors also use deduction (establishing logical conclusion based on logically true statements). Conscious deduction is the slowest type of inference as it requires intelligent actor's active participation to build a "logical chain".
 
It is not clear if intelligent actors cognition actually handles these three methods of inference differently, it is probabilistically unlikely that this is the case as these are artifical concepts. It is more likely that intelligent actors' cognition uses the same model for all reasoning; the only difference is actors' conscious participation.
 
It is authors hypothesis that intelligent actors most likely use deduction with faulty premises. This faulty type of deduction auto corrects and converges to an actual "relatively correct deduction" as intelligent actors probe their environment, gather more data and update and expand their associations.
